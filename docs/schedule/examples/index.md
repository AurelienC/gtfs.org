# GTFS Schedule Examples

To help in understanding the GTFS specification and in producing tools that read and write GTFS data, take a look at the following examples of GTFS feeds:

- The [Example GTFS Feed page](/schedule/example-feed) provides a simple GTFS feed that can be used as a model to understand how a GTFS feed is put together.
- The [Data Examples page](/schedule/data-examples) provides instructions on modeling specific use cases.
- See [OpenMobilityData](https://openmobilitydata.org/) for public feeds from real transit agencies.
