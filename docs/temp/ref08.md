### Dataset Attributes
The **primary key** of a dataset is the field or combination of fields that uniquely identify a row. `Primary key (*)` is used when all provided fields for a file are used to uniquely identify a row. `Primary key (none)` means that the file allows only one row. 

_Example: the `trip_id` and `stop_sequence` fields make the primary key of [stop_times.txt](#stop_timestxt)._
