Notes on above table:

* On Friday into Saturday morning, for example, a single vehicle operates `trip_1`, `trip_2`, and `trip_3` (10:00 PM through 12:55 AM). Note that the last trip occurs on Saturday, 12:00 AM to 12:55 AM, but is part of the Friday “service day” because the times are 24:00:00 to 24:55:00.
* On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday, a single vehicle operates `trip_1`, `trip_4`, and `trip_5` in a block from 8:00 PM to 10:55 PM.
