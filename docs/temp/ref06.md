### Field Types

- **Color** - A color encoded as a six-digit hexadecimal number. Refer to [https://htmlcolorcodes.com](https://htmlcolorcodes.com) to generate a valid value (the leading "#" must not be included). <br> *Example: `FFFFFF` for white, `000000` for black or `0039A6` for the A,C,E lines in NYMTA.*
- **Currency code** - An ISO 4217 alphabetical currency code. For the list of current currency, refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active\_codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes). <br> *Example: `CAD` for Canadian dollars, `EUR` for euros or `JPY` for Japanese yen.*
- **Currency amount** - A decimal value indicating a currency amount. The number of decimal places is specified by [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217#Active_codes) for the accompanying Currency code. All financial calculations should be processed as decimal, currency, or another equivalent type suitable for financial calculations depending on the programming language used to consume data. Processing currency amounts as float is discouraged due to gains or losses of money during calculations.
- **Date** - Service day in the YYYYMMDD format. Since time within a service day may be above 24:00:00, a service day may contain information for the subsequent day(s). <br> *Example: `20180913` for September 13th, 2018.*
- **Email** - An email address. <br> *Example: `example@example.com`*
- **Enum** - An option from a set of predefined constants defined in the "Description" column. <br> *Example: The `route_type` field contains a `0` for tram, a `1` for subway...*
- **ID** - An ID field value is an internal ID, not intended to be shown to riders, and is a sequence of any UTF-8 characters. Using only printable ASCII characters is recommended. An ID is labeled "unique ID" when it must be unique within a file. IDs defined in one .txt file are often referenced in another .txt file. IDs that reference an ID in another table are labeled "foreign ID".<br> *Example: The `stop_id` field in [stops.txt](#stopstxt) is a "unique ID". The `parent_station` field in [stops.txt](#stopstxt) is a "foreign ID referencing `stops.stop_id`".*
- **Language code** - An IETF BCP 47 language code. For an introduction to IETF BCP 47, refer to [https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt) and [https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/](https://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/). <br> *Example: `en` for English, `en-US` for American English or `de` for German.*
- **Latitude** - WGS84 latitude in decimal degrees. The value must be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to 90.0. *<br> Example: `41.890169` for the Colosseum in Rome.*
- **Longitude** - WGS84 longitude in decimal degrees. The value must be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to 180.0. <br> *Example: `12.492269` for the Colosseum in Rome.*
- **Float** - A floating point number.
- **Integer** - An integer.
- **Phone number** - A phone number.
- **Time** - Time in the HH:MM:SS format (H:MM:SS is also accepted). The time is measured from "noon minus 12h" of the service day (effectively midnight except for days on which daylight savings time changes occur). For times occurring after midnight, enter the time as a value greater than 24:00:00 in HH:MM:SS local time for the day on which the trip schedule begins. <br> *Example: `14:30:00` for 2:30PM or `25:35:00` for 1:35AM on the next day.*
- **Text** - A string of UTF-8 characters, which is aimed to be displayed and which must therefore be human readable.
- **Timezone** - TZ timezone from the [https://www.iana.org/time-zones](https://www.iana.org/time-zones). Timezone names never contain the space character but may contain an underscore. Refer to [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tz\_zones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_tz\_zones) for a list of valid values. <br> *Example: `Asia/Tokyo`, `America/Los_Angeles` or `Africa/Cairo`.*
- **URL** - A fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https://, and any special characters in the URL must be correctly escaped. See the following [https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4\_URI\_Recommentations.html](https://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4\_URI\_Recommentations.html) for a description of how to create fully qualified URL values.
