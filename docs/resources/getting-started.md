# Getting started

If this is your first time dealing with transit data, you might find these links useful:

- [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) - A GTFS feed is a group of text files that contains infrequently changing transit data, like stops, routes, trips, and other schedule data. Transit agencies typically update their GTFS feed every few months.
- [GTFS Realtime](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) - GTFS Realtime consists of three binary files that contain realtime vehicle positions, realtime arrival information, and service alerts. Transit agencies typically update these files every minute.
- [World Bank - "Intro. to GTFS" online course](https://olc.worldbank.org/content/introduction-general-transit-feed-specification-gtfs-and-informal-transit-system-mapping) - A free, online, self-paced course for learning about GTFS and GTFS-realtime.
- [Open Transit Data Toolkit](https://transitdatatoolkit.com/) - A series of lessons to help people utilize open transit data.
- [MBTA GTFS Onboarding](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mbta/gtfs_onboarding/main?urlpath=lab/tree/GTFS_Onboarding.ipynb) - An interactive tutorial created by MBTA for GTFS static. A [stand-alone Docker image](https://github.com/mbta/gtfs_onboarding) is available on GitHub as well as a [hosted/no-install version](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mbta/gtfs_onboarding/main?urlpath=lab/tree/GTFS_Onboarding.ipynb) of the Jupyter notebook.
