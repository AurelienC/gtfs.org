# GTFS: Making Public Transit Data Universally Accessible 

The General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) is a data specification that allows public transit agencies to publish their transit data in a format that can be consumed by a [wide variety of software applications](resources/apps). Today, the GTFS data format is used by thousands of public transport providers.

GTFS is split into a [schedule component](schedule) that contains schedule, fare, and geographic transit information and a [real-time component](realtime) that contains arrival predictions, vehicle positions and service advisories.
