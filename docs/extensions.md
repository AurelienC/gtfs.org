# Extensions

GTFS is a community driven data format. Users can propose and vote on changes. For detailed information see the [GTFS Schedule](../schedule/process) and [GTFS Realtime](../realtime/process) amendment process.

Extensions that are currently in development can be found on MobilityData's [roadmap](https://portal.productboard.com/y3dqmkhjlmyst65bap8sx9kd/tabs/9-in-progress).

Extension proposals can be found in the following places:

- MobilityData maintains a [portal with a list of GTFS extension proposals](https://bit.ly/gtfs-extensions). The roadmap is based on their members' prioritization. You can contribute ideas or extensions via the portal.
- TransitWiki.org contains a [list GTFS extension projects](https://www.transitwiki.org/TransitWiki/index.php/General_Transit_Feed_Specification#GTFS_Extensions).
