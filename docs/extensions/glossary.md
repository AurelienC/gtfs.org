# GTFS Extension Glossary 

* **Core** - The Core GTFS is defined by the original set of files and fields in the GTFS data model. 

* **Extension** - A GTFS extension is an addition of files or fields to the Core GTFS data model.

* **Feature** - A GTFS feature is a transit use case that can be modeled by the Canonical GTFS data model. For example: stop locations; special holiday schedules; pathway navigation within a station, are all canonical features of GTFS. 

* **Canonical / Official** - Canonical, or official, refers to all documentation and specifications as defined on the main branch of the google/transit Github repository.

* **Unofficial** - Unofficial GTFS extensions are an addition of files or fields to the Core GTFS data model that have not been formally proposed or adopted into the canonical specification. Agencies may partner with consuming apps to implement unofficial GTFS extensions to serve a user need.

* **Proposal** - As defined by article 3 of the Specification Amendment Process, a GTFS proposal is an unofficial/unadopted GTFS extension that has been proposed as a pull request on the google/transit Github repository and which has been announced on the GTFS mailing list.

* **Adopted Proposal / Adopted Extension** - An adopted GTFS proposal, or adopted GTFS extension, is a proposal that has passed a community vote as outlined by the Specification Amendment Process. Once a proposal has passed, it becomes an official feature of GTFS. An adopted proposal may be referred to as an “official GTFS extension”.

* **Specification Amendment Process** - The Specification Amendment Process is a voting procedure through which GTFS proposals become either adopted or rejected unanimously by the GTFS community. Any change to the GTFS data model must be approved via the Specification Amendment Process. After a GTFS proposal has been accepted via the Specification Amendment Process, the proposal becomes an official part of GTFS.
