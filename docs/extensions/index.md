# Extensions

Additional files and fields can be extended onto GTFS datasets to accommodate a variety of application-specific needs, even if these fields are not in the official specification. Below is a list of GTFS extensions that may be implemented. Note that some of these extensions may become active proposals and subsequently merged into the official specification via the Specification Amendment Process.
